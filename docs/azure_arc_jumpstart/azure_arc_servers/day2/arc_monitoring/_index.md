## Enable Azure Monitor on Azure Arc-enabled servers

The scenario will show you how to onboard Azure Arc-enabled servers to [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview), so you can monitor your Linux and Windows servers running on-premises or at other cloud providers.


In this guide, you will create the following Azure resources that support this Azure Monitor scenario:

* Log Analytics workspace.

* Log data sources: performance counters and events for Windows & Linux.

* VM Insights solution.

* Azure Monitor OS sample alerts.

* Azure Workbooks: AlertsConsole, OSPerformanceAndCapacity and WindowsEvents.

* Azure Dashboard: monitoring overview for Azure Arc-enabled servers.

* Azure Policies to automate agents deployment:
    
    * Configure Log Analytics extension on Azure Arc enabled Windows servers.

    * Configure Log Analytics extension on Azure Arc enabled Linux servers.

    * Configure Dependency agent on Azure Arc enabled Windows servers.

    * Configure Dependency agent on Azure Arc enabled Linux server.

> **Note: This guide assumes you already deployed VMs or servers that are running on-premises or other clouds and you have connected them to Azure Arc. If you haven't, this repository offers you a way to do so in an automated fashion:**

* **[GCP Ubuntu instance](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/gcp/gcp_terraform_ubuntu/)**
* **[GCP Windows instance](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/gcp/gcp_terraform_windows/)**
* **[AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/aws/aws_terraform_ubuntu/)**
* **[AWS Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/aws/aws_terraform_al2/)**
* **[Azure Ubuntu VM](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/azure/azure_arm_template_linux/)**
* **[Azure Windows VM](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/azure/azure_arm_template_win/)**
* **[VMware vSphere Ubuntu VM](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/vmware/vmware_terraform_ubuntu/)**
* **[VMware vSphere Windows Server VM](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/vmware/vmware_terraform_winsrv/)**
* **[Vagrant Ubuntu box](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/vagrant/local_vagrant_ubuntu/)**
* **[Vagrant Windows box](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/vagrant/local_vagrant_windows/)**

## Prerequisites

* CloneÂ the Azure Arc Jumpstart repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc.git
    ```

* As mentioned, this guide starts at the point where you already deployed and connected VMs or bare-metal servers to Azure Arc. For this scenario, we will use the following instances that has been already connected to Azure Arc and is visible as a resource in Azure:

    ![Screenshot showing AWS cloud console with EC2 instance](./25.png)
    
    > **Note: Ensure that the server you will use for this scenario is running an [OS supported by the Log Analytics Agent and the Dependency Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#supported-operating-systems) and meets the [firewall requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent#firewall-requirements).**

* [Install or update Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Azure CLI should be running version 2.14 or later. Use ```az --version``` to check your current installed version.

## Onboarding Azure Monitor

* First, create a new resource group where all the resources mentioned above will be deployed. Please, run the below command, replacing the values in brackets with your own.

    ```shell
    az group create --name <Name for your resource group> \
    --location <Location for your resources> \
    --tags "Project=jumpstart_azure_arc_servers"
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing az group create being run](./03.png)

* Next, edit the ARM template [parameters file](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_servers_jumpstart/monitoring/monitoring-template.json), providing a name for your Log Analytics workspace and a single email account, which will be used for Azure Monitor alerts notifications. Please, see the [example](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_servers_jumpstart/monitoring/monitoring-template.example.parameters.json) below:

    ![Screenshot showing Azure ARM template](./04.png)

* To deploy the ARM template, navigate to the [deployment folder](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/tree/main/azure_arc_servers_jumpstart/monitoring) and run the below command:

    ```shell
    az deployment group create --resource-group <Name of the Azure resource group you created> \
        --template-file monitoring-template.json \
        --parameters monitoring-template.parameters.json
    ```

   ![Screenshot showing az deployment group create being run](./05.png)

* When the deployment is complete, you should be able to see the resource group with your Log Analytics workspace, azure dashboard, vminsights solution and three workbooks: 

    ![Screenshot showing Azure Portal with resources deployed](./06.png)

* Please, note that most of the deployed resources are hidden:

    ![Screenshot showing Azure Portal hidden resources](./19.png)

## Confirm that the Azure Monitor resources are deployed

* Click on the **Policies** blade of the **resource group** where you deployed this scenario, and verify that the following **policies** are assigned: 

    ![Screenshot showing Azure Policies assigned at resource group](./12.png)

* Click on the **Agents Configuration** blade of the **Log Analytics workspace** and verify that the following **data sources** are enabled:

    ![Screenshot showing Windows Events of Log Analytics workspace](./07.png)

    ![Screenshot showing Windows Performance Counters of Log Analytics workspace](./08.png)

    ![Screenshot showing Linux Performance Counters of Log Analytics workspace](./09.png)

    ![Screenshot showing Syslog of Log Analytics workspace](./10.png)

* Click on the **Solutions** blade of the **Log Analytics workspace** and verify that  **VM Insights** is enabled:

    ![Screenshot showing VMInsights solution of Log Analytics workspace](./11.png)

* Go to **Monitor**, **Alerts** and click on **Action Groups**: 

    ![Screenshot showing steps to list action groups](./13.png)

* Filter by **Subscription** and **Resource Group**, and verify the following **action group** is created: 

    ![Screenshot showing action group created](./14.png)

* Click on the **action group name**, then on the **edit** button, and verify the **email account** is the one you provided in the **parameters file**: 

    ![Screenshot showing how to click on action group name](./15.png)

* Go to **Monitor**, **Alerts** and click on **Alert rules**: 

    ![Screenshot showing steps to list alerts](./17.png)

* Filter by **Subscription** and **Resource Group**, and verify the following **alerts** are enabled: 

    ![Screenshot showing created alerts](./18.png)

    > **Note: This is just a small example of Azure Monitor alerts, based on log queries and log analytics workspace metrics. You may need to adjust alerts thresholds to your environment expected behaviour.**

## Deploying the Log Analytics Agent and the Dependency Agent
This scenario is mainly based on the data collected from the Azure Arc-enabled servers into the Log Analytics workspace. Therefore, it is required to deploy on these servers the [Log Analytics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#log-analytics-agent) and the [Dependency Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#dependency-agent). There are multiple [methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent#installation-options) to deploy these agents. In this scenario, Azure Policies are used to deploy both agents in Windows and Linux. 

For **new** Azure Arc-enabled servers connected within the scope of the policies assignments, the policies will deploy the agents automatically.

For **existing** Azure Arc-enabled servers connected within the scope of the policies assignments, you will need to manually create a remediation task for each policy. These are steps to create a remediation task:

* When the Azure Policies are assigned, it takes around 30 minutes for the assignment to be applied to the defined scope. After those 30 minutes, Azure Policy will start the evaluation cycle against the Azure Arc-enabled servers and recognize them as "Non-compliant" if they don't have the Log Analytics Agent or the Dependency Agent installed. To check this, go to the **resource group** where you deployed this scenario, and click on the **Policies** blade:

    ![Screenshot showing Azure Policies blade at resource group](./20.png)

* Click on the **Remediation** tab. Check if any of the policies that deploy the agents have resources to remediate. If so, click on the **Remediate** button:

    > **Note: The following steps must be followed for each policy with resources pending to be remediated. Please, start with the remediation of the Log Analytics agent policies followed by the remediation of the Dependency Agent policies.**

    ![Screenshot showing how to start Azure policy remediation](./21.png)

* Review the following settings and click on the **Remediate** button:

    ![Screenshot showing how to remediate an Azure Policy](./22.png)

* Once you have assigned remediation task, the policy will be evaluated again and show that the Azure Arc-enabled server is compliant:

   ![Screenshot showing Azure Policy compliant results](./23.png)

* The agents will be installed as extensions in the Azure Arc-enabled server:
