# Azure Arc Jumpstart commitment to open-source software

The Azure Arc Jumpstart holds much automation for numerous amount of scenarios, and for us, it is critical to maintain high code quality. To do that, it is important to not just go trough extensive code reviews and testing, but also select and embed the right tool for the job.

It is our mission to support the open-source community whenever we can and build on the amazing work of others when we present the opportunity to do so. With more then 30 open-source projects used in the Jumpstart, we are committed to continue to support, advocate and contribute to these projects, so you will get no less then an AWESOME experience using the Azure Arc Jumpstart!
